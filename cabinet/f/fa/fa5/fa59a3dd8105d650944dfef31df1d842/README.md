# Using Bash in Flatpak VSCode

Because Flatpak VSCode on Linux is sand-boxed it isnâ€™t possible to
access many of the native system commands, including running Bash in the
integrated terminal. To work around this the following code can be
appended to the settings.json file:

    "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux": "bash",
    "terminal.integrated.profiles.linux": {
      "bash": {
        "path": "/usr/bin/env",
        "args": ["--", "flatpak-spawn", "--host", "--env=TERM=xterm-256color", "bash"]
      }
    }
